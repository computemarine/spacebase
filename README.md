# spacebase
Spacebase is a fake database created for the purpose of fulfilling the final project requirements of CNIT 272: Database Fundamentals. Naturally, it is amalgomation of real and fake data on NASA, ROSCOSMOS, CSA, and ESA astro/cosmonauts.

## A Note
Seeing as this was the only SQL class I took in undergrad, one I quite enjoyed, and completed this project solo (love "group" projects) I moved the files here from discontinued Purdue repository for the purpose of having something to reference back to if I ever need SQL again...
