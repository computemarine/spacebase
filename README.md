# spacebase
Spacebase is a fake NASA database created for the purpose of fulfilling the final project requirements of CNIT 272: Database Fundamentals. Seeing as this was the only SQL class I took in undergrad, one I quite enjoyed, and completed this project solo (love "group" projects) I moved the files here from discontinued Purdue repository.
